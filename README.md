This project has assignments from the Machine Learning by Stanford University Course taught by Andrew Ng

Note: In all the uploaded jupyter-lab files, "%matplotlib widget" is removed. While running on actual jupyter-lab environment,
please add that line at the top of the file to get interactive plots. Otherwise they will all be only static.
